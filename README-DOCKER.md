#Overengineering.

Ok so I built a complete cluster using kubernetes and yaml's.

hit some firewall issues.

I decided for the scope of this project, I will simply deploy docker in a micro instance and pull a compose file.

so basically we just now run ansible-playbook docker-playbook.yml (put your keys in)
