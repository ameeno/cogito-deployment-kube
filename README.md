Congratulations on progressing to this part of the DevOps screening process.

This test will evaluate skills via a take-home project. You will find the project requirements in this directory. Please treat this project as if you are delivering it to a client.

The requirements for the test project are:

- You want to design a continuous delivery architecture for a scalable and secure 3 tier Node application, the source code for the applications can be found in ./src.

- Both web and API tiers should be exposed to the internet and DB tier should not be accessible from the internet.Â 

* You need to create resources for all the tiers - use Postgres as your database layer.
* The architecture should be completely provisioned via some infrastructure as a code tool.
* The deployment of new code should be completely automated, each tier should be capable of being updated independently of others.
* You should keep use the ./src directory as a base for your solution, it can be copied to any subdirectory you wish
* You should be able to deploy it on one larger Cloud provider: AWS / Google Cloud / Azure / DigitalOcean / RackSpace.
* All the relevant configuration scripts (eg. Terraform/Chef/Puppet/cfengine/ansible/cloud formation)
